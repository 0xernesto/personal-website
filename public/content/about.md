Hi, I'm Ernesto. I'm an engineer interested in the intersection of AI and Web3. I'm currently based in the SF Bay Area, working on [Odos](https://odos.xyz) full time.

I've been working on crypto projects since 2022. Some of my recent projects include: [Pesto](https://ernestor.xyz/projects/pesto), [xSafe](https://ernestor.xyz/projects/xsafe), and [Ax Protocol](https://ernestor.xyz/projects/ax-protocol). Previously I worked in the aerospace industry â€” first as a flight test engineer at [Textron Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textron_Aviation), then as a manufacturing operations engineer at [Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodward,_Inc.).

I hold a BS in Aerospace Engineering from Purdue University, and I'm enrolled as a graduate CS student at Georgia Tech, where I occasionally take classes.

I like to run, bike, and learn new things. [Reach out](https://ernestor.xyz/contact) if you want to chat or meet up.
