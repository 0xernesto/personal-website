Hi, I'm Ernesto. I like to work on projects that can enhance global living standards, boost economic freedom, or address inefficiencies in societal systems.

I'm currently spending a lot of time learning, reading books, and building open-source projects in the crypto space.

Some of my recent work includes building:

-   [Pesto](https://ernestor.xyz/projects/pesto) - A DeFi protocol that enables users to create independent short and long positions in a single transaction.
-   [xSafe](https://ernestor.xyz/projects/xsafe) - A deterministic smart contract deployer.
-   [Ax Protocol](https://ernestor.xyz/projects/ax-protocol) - The interoperability protocol that powers the [USX](https://docs.ax.finance/overview/usx) cross-chain stablecoin.
-   [Pelleum](https://ernestor.xyz/projects/pelleum) - A pseudonymous platform dedicated to reading, writing, and sharing investment content.

Previously I worked in the aerospace industry â€” first as a flight test engineer at [Textron Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textron_Aviation), then as a manufacturing operations engineer at [Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodward,_Inc.).

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Purdue University and I'm currently working on a Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.
