					I'm Ernesto and I spend most of my time learning and
					building in the Web3 space. I want to help build a future
					where incentives within our societies are aligned for
					maximum prosperity and an optimal level of optionality. I
					think that blockchain technology can help boost things like
					economic freedom, property rights, and technological
					innovation around the world. My rationale for this stems
					from the fact that many projects like {"  "}
					<a
						className="underline hover:text-white"
						href="https://ethereum.org/en/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						Ethereum
					</a>{" "}
					have already proven the utility of blockchain technology,
					enabling thousands of socioeconomic experiments to take
					place at an incredibly fast pace. It's very early to tell
					what exactly will ensue, but I believe that these series of
					experiments could eventually lead to new countries (
					<a
						className="underline hover:text-white"
						href="https://thenetworkstate.com"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						network states
					</a>
					) with economic systems that are more conducive to
					exponential progress for humanity. This is because most
					existing countries are deeply grounded in principles that
					were established pre-internet and their protocols are not
					iterated on enough to implement new ideas and get rid of
					what doesn't work. Additionally, many people in current
					governments are inheritors that lack the necessary founder
					qualities of great leaders. Some of these people may have
					had founder qualities at some point, but it's common to see
					them become complacent once they immerse themselves in a
					highly political environment. After that happens, it seems
					that their primary interest is to remain in a position of
					power as long as possible, regardless of how well they
					execute.

					The views I shared above may lead one to believe that I am a
					highly progressive libertarian, but that is not the case. I
					do believe in conserving what has worked in the past that
					still works today, but also coming up with new ideas and
					trying them out. I also strongly believe in the "

					</a>
					" concept, which is neither progressive, nor conservative,
					nor libertarian. I consider myself to be an open-minded
					person. I'm willing to listen to opposing views and change
					my mind if someone has a rational, compelling argument. Most
					importantly, I never let personal views or preferences get
					in the way of getting work done to achieve a common goal.
					The reason I decided to share some of my personal views here
					is because I think it helps illustrate that I am committed
					to working in the Web3 space for reasons that are not solely
					for financial gain or the hype around it. There are very
					serious societal implications to consider when building in
					this space, and it's important for builders to think about
					these implications deeply.

					How I got here.

				<p className="mb-5">
					I'm originally from a small town nested in the {"  "}

					region in Mexico. My parents decided to move to the US when
					I was around 8 years old to provide my siblings and me the
					opportunity for a better future. I grew up on a relatively
					low household income in the Chicago suburbs. At a pretty
					young age, I developed an innate drive to work hard and
					excel in school because I observed how hard some people
					worked just to obtain basic needs. I felt that if I became
					wealthy in the future, I would have more resources to help
					people.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-5">
					Growing up, I never would've guessed a career that involves
					building things on the internet would best align with my
					interests, values, and overall personality. I thought I
					would become a pilot or aircraft engineer because I was
					fascinated by all things that fly. I earned a{" "}

					</a>{" "}
					to attend Purdue University, graduated in 2018 with a BS in
					aerospace engineering, worked in the aerospace industry for
					a few years, earned my private pilot's license, but still
					felt that something was missing.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-5">
					In a sense, I experienced a quarter-life crisis because I
					felt the need to reevaluate my entire life. First, I had to
					figure out what I did not want to become. I knew I did not
					want to become complacent, climb the corporate ladder, chase
					professional titles, get an MBA degree, or do anything that
					is typically done for social gratification in the corporate
					world today. I strongly considered going to graduate school
					to study computer science and pursuing a career in
					academics, but I came to the conclusion that it would be
					best to do that later in my life if I still have the itch.
					What I wanted was to move fast and build stuff{" "}
					<span className="font-bold">NOW</span>. I wanted to start or
					join an early-stage startup company. I wanted to leverage my
					technical skills in a way that could positively impact large
					masses of people around the world. It became clear that
					software engineering was the best candidate for this
					aspiration, so I decided to spend my nights and weekends
					learning to code and building software projects with one of
					my friends.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-5">
					A few months of software side-projects led to the founding
					of{" "}

					, my first startup. After launching the product and
					analyzing the market's response, my cofounder and I started
					digging into Web3 because we wanted to explore ideas that
					could help us align incentives between Pelleum, its writers,
					and its readers. Long story short, we went deep down the
					Web3 rabbit hole, shut Pelleum down, built a few Ethereum
					dApps, started attending Web3 hackathons, and have not
					looked back. Web3 truly lies at the intersection of my
					interests in science, math, economics, philosophy, and
					startups. I'm constantly learning and building alongside
					very smart people. I enjoy the work that I do and I'm
					totally ok with allocating a very large portion of my
					lifetime to this space.
