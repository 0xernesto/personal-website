					I'm Ernesto and I spend most of my time learning and
					building in the Web3 space. I want to help build a future
					where incentives within our societies are aligned for
					maximum prosperity and an optimal level of optionality. I
					think that blockchain technology can help boost things like
					economic freedom, property rights, and technological
					innovation around the world. My rationale for this stems
					from the fact that many projects like {"  "}
					<a
						className="underline hover:text-white"
						href="https://ethereum.org/en/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						Ethereum
					</a>{" "}
					have already proven the utility of blockchain technology,
					enabling thousands of socioeconomic experiments to take
					place at an incredibly fast pace. It's very early to tell
					what exactly will ensue, but I believe that these series of
					experiments could eventually lead to new countries (
					<a
						className="underline hover:text-white"
						href="https://thenetworkstate.com"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						network states
					</a>
					) with economic systems that are more conducive to
					exponential progress for humanity. This is because most
					existing countries are deeply grounded in principles that
					were established pre-internet, and their protocols are not
					iterated on enough to implement new ideas and get rid of
					what doesn't work. Additionally, many people in current
					governments are inheritors that lack the necessary founder
					qualities of great leaders. Some of these people may have
					had founder qualities at some point, but it's common to see
					them become complacent once they immerse themselves in a
					highly political environment. After that happens, it seems
					that their primary interest is to remain in a position of
					power as long as possible, regardless of how well they
					execute.

					The views I shared above may lead one to believe that I am a
					highly progressive libertarian, but that is not the case. I
					do believe in conserving what has worked in the past that
					still works today, but also coming up with new ideas and
					trying them out. I also strongly believe in the "

					</a>
					" concept, which is neither progressive, nor conservative,
					nor libertarian. I consider myself to be an open-minded
					person. I'm willing to listen to opposing views and change
					my mind if someone has a rational, compelling argument. Most
					importantly, I never let personal views or preferences get
					in the way of getting work done to achieve a common goal.
					The reason I decided to share some of my personal views here
					is because I think it helps illustrate that I am committed
					to working in the Web3 space for reasons that are not solely
					for financial gain or the hype around it. There are very
					serious societal implications to consider when building in
					this space, and it's important for builders to think about
					these implications deeply.

					region in Mexico. My parents decided to move to the US when
					I was around 8 years old to offer my siblings and me a
					higher-quality education. We moved to the Chicago suburbs,
					where some family was already reasiding. From a young age, I
					was fascinated by all things that fly, so I managed to earn

					to attend Purdue University and study aerospace engineering.
					After finishing my degree, I worked in the aerospace
					industry for a few years and earned my private pilot's
					license, but I still felt that something was missing.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-5">
					I couldn't envision myself spending my entire life working
					at a large aerospace company or remaining within the same
					industry. It felt too slow and constraining. To address this
					issue, I first figured out what I did not want to become. I
					knew I did not want to become complacent, climb the
					corporate ladder, chase professional titles, get an MBA
					degree, or engage in any activities primarily driven by
					social validation in today's corporate landscape. I
					seriously contemplated attending graduate school to study
					computer science, electrical engineering, or physics, and
					pursuing a career in academia. However, I came to the
					conclusion that it would be better to explore this path
					later in life, should the desire persist. What I wanted was
					to move fast and build stuff{" "}
					<span className="font-bold">NOW</span>. I wanted to start or
					join an early-stage startup company. I wanted to leverage my
					technical skills in a way that could positively impact large
					masses of people around the world. It soon became clear that
					software engineering was the best candidate for this
					aspiration, so I decided to spend my nights and weekends
					learning to code and building software projects with one of
					my friends.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-5">
					A few months of software side-projects led to the founding
					of{" "}

					, my first startup. After launching the product and
					analyzing the market's response, my cofounder and I started
					digging into Web3 because we wanted to explore ideas that
					could help us align incentives between Pelleum, its content
					writers, and readers. Long story short, we went deep down
					the Web3 rabbit hole, shut Pelleum down, started attending
					Web3 hackathons, and have been building in the space since.
					Web3 truly lies at the intersection of my interests in
					science, math, economics, philosophy, and startups. I'm
					constantly learning and building alongside incredibly smart
					people. I enjoy the work that I do and I'm totally ok with
					allocating a significant portion of my lifetime to this
					space.
