Hi, I'm Ernesto. I'm dedicating my life to innovative, entrepreneurial initiatives with the hope of enhancing global living standards, boosting economic prosperity and freedom, or addressing inefficiencies in existing societal systems.

I'm currently spending a lot of time learning math, reading books, and building open-source projects. However, the ultimate goal is to found a successful [positive-sum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/positive-sum) startup.

Some of my recent work includes building [Ax Protocol](https://www.ax.finance), which powers the [USX](https://docs.ax.finance/overview/usx) cross-chain native stablecoin, and cofounding [Pelleum](https://ernestor.xyz/projects/pelleum), a pseudonymous platform for reading, writing, and sharing investment content.

Previously I worked in the aerospace industry â€” first as a flight test engineer at [Textron Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textron_Aviation), then as a manufacturing operations engineer at [Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodward,_Inc.).

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Purdue University and I'm currently enrolled in a Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.
