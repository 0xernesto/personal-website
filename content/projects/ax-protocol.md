**NOTE:** I contributed to this project using the [0xhashmap](https://github.com/0xhashmap) pseudonym due to regulatory uncertainty in the United States. However, I have decided to use my real name for building and communicating ideas moving forward.

All the work described below was completed solely by me and another engineer.

## Official Docs

The official docs for the Ax Protocol can be found at [docs.ax.finance](https://docs.ax.finance).

## Smart Contracts

The Ax Protocol has four primary [ERC-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967) proxy contracts: [USX](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/token/USX.sol), [Treasury](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/treasury/Treasury.sol), [LayerZeroBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/layer_zero/LayerZeroBridge.sol), and [WormholeBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/wormhole/WormholeBridge.sol). These smart contracts underwent rigorous internal and external audits. The external auditor was [Ottersec](https://osec.io), one of the top smart contract security firms at the time the protocol was built. The final draft of Ottersec's audit report can be found [here](https://docs.ax.finance/references/audit-reports).

[USX](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/token/USX.sol), [LayerZeroBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/layer_zero/LayerZeroBridge.sol), and [WormholeBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/wormhole/WormholeBridge.sol) were deployed to 9 different chains: Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum One, Polygon, Gnosis, Celo, Avalanche C-Chain, Fantom, and BNB Smart Chain. The [Treasury](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/treasury/Treasury.sol) contract was only deployed to Ethereum.

#### USX

Address (same on all chains): <a style="word-break: break-all;" href="https://blockscan.com/address/0x89718f712da063Bac92CaC3468F109db852B05ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x89718f712da063Bac92CaC3468F109db852B05ff</a>

The [USX](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/token/USX.sol) contract adheres to the [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard and incorporates cross-chain messaging for seamless transfers between blockchains. The contract has all standard [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) functions like **approve()** and **transfer()**, along with **sendFrom()**, a specialized function that enables cross-chain transfers of USX. Transfers are executed by burning USX on the source chain and minting an equal amount on the destination chain. Minting and redeeming are restricted to authorized accounts, specifically the [Treasury](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/treasury/Treasury.sol) contract, which manages the asset-backing of USX.

USX is designed to be bridge-agnostic, enabling the use of any message-passing protocol for cross-chain transfers. Although it makes sense to only use one message-passing protocol at a time to minimize attack vectors, the ability to switch between primary and backup bridges provides an additional layer of security. This bridge modularity also future-proofs USX, considering that better message-passing protocols may emerge in the future. [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network) and [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com) are the only message-passing protocols supported at the time of writing this. Supporting other protocols, like [Axelar](https://axelar.network), would require building a bridging contract that integrates with the Axelar network (e.g., AxelarBridge).

#### Treasury

Address (Ethereum): <a style="word-break: break-all;" href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x71c814A26ef81a9A3B196D73DdD1942E2DF815ed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x71c814A26ef81a9A3B196D73DdD1942E2DF815ed</a>

The [Treasury](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/treasury/Treasury.sol) contract ensures the stability of the USX token value, maintaining its peg to the US dollar (1 USX â‰ˆ $1). Curve's [3Pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/3pool/deposit) is utilized to maintain USX liquidity.

Users can deposit DAI, USDC, USDT, or 3CRV (the [3Pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/3pool/deposit) LP token) into the [Treasury](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/treasury/Treasury.sol) contract to receive USX. This process involves the **mint()** function: when called, it deposits the provided token into Curve's [3Pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/3pool/deposit), which gives back 3CRV. If 3CRV is already provided, this step is skipped. The 3CRV is staked on [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/) and the **mint()** function is subsequently called in the [USX](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/token/USX.sol) contract to mint the user USX.

Conversely, users can exchange USX for DAI, USDC, USDT, or 3CRV through the [Treasury](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/treasury/Treasury.sol) contract. This involves the **redeem()** function: users specify an amount of USX to exchange, which triggers the unstaking of an equivalent amount of 3CRV from [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/). If necessary, this 3CRV is exchanged in Curve's [3Pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/3pool/deposit) for the desired token (DAI, USDC, or USDT). The supplied USX is burnt using the **burn()** function in the [USX](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/token/USX.sol) contract and the chosen token is given to the user.

#### LayerZeroBridge

Address (same on all chains): <a style="word-break: break-all;" href="https://blockscan.com/address/0x8d8F6f500983AC946D711E7a85661cb701C0CE5F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x8d8F6f500983AC946D711E7a85661cb701C0CE5F</a>

The [LayerZeroBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/layer_zero/LayerZeroBridge.sol) contract is specifically designed to enable the [USX](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/token/USX.sol) contract to send and receive cross-chain messages via [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network). When the **sendFrom()** function in the [USX](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/token/USX.sol) contract is called, a cross-chain message is initiated. The [LayerZeroBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/layer_zero/LayerZeroBridge.sol) contract serves as a [User Application](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/faq/glossary) in the LayerZero network, since it implements the logic to talk to [LayerZero Endpoints](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/faq/layerzero-endpoint), which handle message transmission, verification, and receipt. LayerZero runs their own [message relayer system](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/ecosystem/relayer/develop-a-relayer) to handle message verification and delivery to destination chains.

#### WormholeBridge

Address (same on all chains): <a style="word-break: break-all;" href="https://blockscan.com/address/0x4800c8d6Ba7176F084004c0294320B634e3476f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x4800c8d6Ba7176F084004c0294320B634e3476f8</a>

The [WormholeBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/wormhole/WormholeBridge.sol) contract is specifically designed to enable the [USX](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/token/USX.sol) contract to send and receive cross-chain messages via [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com). When the **sendFrom()** function in the [USX](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/token/USX.sol) contract is called, a cross-chain message is initiated. The [WormholeBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/wormhole/WormholeBridge.sol) contract serves as an [Emitter (or xDapp)](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/components#on-chain-components) in the Wormhole network, since it implements the logic to talk to [Wormhole Core Contracts](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/core-contracts), which [Guardians (validator nodes)](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/guardian) in the Wormhole network observe to validate messages. A [specialized off-chain relayer](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/relayer#specialized-relayers) was built by the Ax Protocol team to listen for validated USX messages in the Wormhole network and deliver them to their respective destination chain.

<!-- **************************************************** -->

## Off-Chain Backend Services

#### Wormhole Message Relayer

This was the first Python relayer system built for Wormhole cross-chain messages. This service consists of two primary components: (1) the Spy Listener and (2) the Relayer.

The Spy Listener listens to the Wormhole network for validated Ax Protocol messages via gRPC stream. When a message is picked up, it is parsed and sent to a [Redis](https://redis.io) queue. The Relayer then picks up messages from the [Redis](https://redis.io) queue and delivers them to their respective destination chain.

#### AxScan

The AxScan service listens to on-chain events emitted by [LayerZeroBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/layer_zero/LayerZeroBridge.sol) and [WormholeBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/wormhole/WormholeBridge.sol) to track the status of USX cross-chain transfers. The status can be obtained via a public API endpoint.

#### Gas System

This service is tasked with running a statistical analysis on the gas prices of all Ax Protocol-supported chains to update the destination chain fees on [WormholeBridge](https://github.com/Ax-Protocol/usx-contracts/blob/main/src/bridging/wormhole/WormholeBridge.sol). This is done by calling the **setSendFees()** function.

## Frontends

All frontends were built using TypeScript, Next.js, and TailwindCSS.
